## Introduction and Use Case
### WineEnthusiast is a very popular magazine for wine consumers, ranging from the curious consumer to the master sommelier. This well known site also functions as a shopping site. There is a lot of educational articles about wine so this is also an educational site. Additonally, people can post their reviews on a wide variety of wines, making this an interactive blogging platform.
### Wine is important because it has a lot of significance in many different cultures around the world. The most obvious area of the world is of course Europe, although it is also heavily emphasized everywhere else in the world. Many people enjoy and consume wine, making this a very relatable commodity. More importantly this is a highly desirable commodity, and ideally people would like to purchase good quality wine in relation to their purchase price. In the interest of the wine consumer, I would like to analyze wine reviews to predict its purchase price. This exploration will better inform the wine consumer on what affects their wine price.
